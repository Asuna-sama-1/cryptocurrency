Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup
When it comes to web scraping, the BeautifulSoup library is what I recommend for beginners like me. Just as its name suggests, it allows you to scrap data out of HTML and XML files beautifully, and here is the tutorial that helped me understand all the components of web pages and the basis of web scrapping.

Part 1: Getting all the coin names

Part 2: Scrapping historical data via API V3
